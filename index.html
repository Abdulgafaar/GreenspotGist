                        <p>Organizations face many threats to their information systems and data. Understanding all the basic elements to cyber security is the first step to meeting those threats.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this short article I will talk abit about what cybersecurity is and types of cybersecrity threats</p>
                        <p>Cyber security is the practice of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality and availability (ICA) of information. It represents the ability to defend against and recover from accidents like hard drive failures or power outages, and from attacks by adversaries. The latter includes everyone from script kiddies to hackers and criminal groups capable of executing advanced persistent threats (APTs), and they pose serious threats to the enterprise. Business continuity and disaster recovery planning are every bit as critical to cyber security as application and network security. Security should be top of mind across the enterprise, and come with a mandate from senior management. The fragility of the information world we now live in also demands strong cyber security controls. Management should see that all systems are built to certain security standards and that employees are properly trained. All code, for example, has bugs, and some of those bugs are security flaws. Developers are only human, after all.</p>

                        <h3>Types of cyber threats</h3>

<p>Common cyber threats fall under three general categories:</p>
<ul>
    <p>
<li><b>Attacks on confidentiality:</b> Stealing, or rather copying, a target's personal information is how many cyber attacks begin, including garden-variety criminal attacks like credit card fraud, identity theft, or stealing bitcoin wallets. Nation-state spies make confidentiality attacks a major portion of their work, seeking to acquire confidential information for political, military, or economic gain.</li>
</p>
<p><li><b>Attacks on integrity:</b> Also known by its common name, sabotage, integrity attacks seek to corrupt, damage, or destroy information or systems, and the people who rely on them. Integrity attacks can be subtle — a typo here, a bit fiddled there — or a slash and burn campaign of sabotage against a target. Perpetrators can range from script kiddies to nation-state attackers.</li></p>
<p>
<li><b>Attacks on availability: </b>Preventing a target from accessing their data is most frequently seen today in the form of ransomware and denial-of-service attacks. Ransomware encrypts a target's data and demands a ransom to decrypt it. A denial-of-service attack, typically in the form of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, floods a network resource with requests, making it unavailable.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>The following describes the means by which these attacks are carried out.</p>
<h3>Social engineering</h3>
<p>
Attackers aren't going to hack a computer if they can hack a human instead. Socially engineered malware, often used to deliver ransomware, is the No. 1 method of attack (not a buffer overflow, misconfiguration, or advanced exploit). An end-user is tricked into running a Trojan horse program, often from a website they trust and visit often. Ongoing user education is the best countermeasure against this attack.</p>
<h3>Phishing attacks</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the best way to steal someone's password is to trick them into revealing it This accounts for the spectacular success of phishing. Even smart users, well-trained in security, can fall for a phishing attack. That's why the best defense is two-factor authentication (2FA) — a stolen password is worthless to an attacker without a second factor, such as hardware security token, or soft token authenticator app on the user's phone.</p>
<h3>Unpatched software</h3>
<p>
It's hard to blame your enterprise if an attacker deploys a zero-day exploit against you, but failure to patch looks a lot like failure to perform due diligence. If months and years pass after disclosure of a vulnerability, and your enterprise has not applied that security patch, you open yourself to accusations of negligence. Patch, patch, patch.</p>
<h3>Social media threats</h3>
<p>
Catfishing isn't just for the dating scene. Believable sock puppet accounts can worm their way through your LinkedIn network. If someone who knows 100 of your professional contacts strikes up a conversation about your work, are you going to think it strange? Loose lips sink ships. Expect social media espionage, of both the industrial and nation-state variety.</p>
<h3>Advanced persistent threats</h3>
<p>
Speaking of nation-state adversaries, your enterprise has them. Don't be surprised if multiple APTs are playing hide-and-go-seek on your corporate network. If you're doing anything remotely interesting to someone, anywhere, you need to consider your security posture against sophisticated APTs. Nowhere is this more true than in the technology space, an industry rich with valuable intellectual property many criminals and nations will not scruple to steal.</p>

                        <h3>Security Training</h3>

<p>The human is always the weakest element in any cyber security program. Training developers to code securely, training operations staff to prioritize a strong security posture, training end users to spot phishing emails and social engineering attacks — cyber security begins with awareness.</p>

<p>All companies will experience some kind of cyber attack, even if strong controls are in place. An attacker will always exploit the weakest link, and many attacks are easily preventable by performing basic security tasks, sometimes referred to as “cyber hygiene.” A surgeon would never enter an operating room without washing their hands first. Likewise, an enterprise has a duty to perform the basic elements of cyber security care such as maintaining strong authentication practices and not storing sensitive data where it is openly accessible.</p>

<p>A good cyber security strategy needs to go beyond these basics, though. Sophisticated hackers can circumvent most defenses, and the attack surface — the number of ways or “vectors” an attacker can gain entry to a system — is expanding for most companies. For example, the information and the physical world are merging, and criminals and nation-state spies now threaten the ICA of cyber-physical systems such as cars, power plants, medical devices, even your IoT fridge. Similarly, the trends toward cloud computing, bring your own device (BYOD) policies in the workplace, and the burgeoning internet of things (IoT) create new challenges. Defending these systems has never been more important.</p>

<p>Further complicating cyber security is the regulatory climate around consumer privacy. Compliance with stringent regulatory frameworks like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also demands new kinds of roles to ensure that organizations meet the privacy and security mandates of the GDPR and other regulations.</p>

<p>As a result, growing demand for cyber security professionals has hiring managers struggling to fill positions with qualified candidates. That struggle requires organizations to have a sharp focus on areas of greatest risk.

<p>Cloud computing is the term used to describe technology that will replace how we currently use our computers and software applications.
The concept of cloud computing is that any device (computer invention) connected to the internet can utilize a network of computing resources.
This would include infrastructure, applications and storage for far less than what it would cost to use your own hardware, software and resources.</p>

<p>Additionally, it allows users to have access to applications that they would not have otherwise. Access is as simple as using an interface application or just a web browser from any location.

The cloud can allow access to millions of computers in an intelligent, scalable and redundant system with expert support.

Similar to outsourcing, the difference and advantages of cloud computing are speed, efficiency, capability and cost, particularly with the increasing popularity of smart phones and tablets.

It allows users to work from anywhere, to perform any task with any application, and to pay for only what you use.</p>

<p>Cloud computing is comparable to using email or online banking where you log into your account to access and manage your information. The software, applications and storage do not exist on your computer.

But unlike your email or online banking services, clouds can perform complicated engineering tasks, schematics, modeling or mathematical computations, and it can do this in a cost effective and efficient manner.</p>

<p>Another major advantage to cloud computing is the reliability of service.

Servers can crash, temporarily denying you online access to services and data. But cloud computing has multiple servers so you always have access.

Some concerns about cloud computing are security and the effect it will have on the computer industry.

The security concerns are similar to those regarding email and online banking.

These have proven to have reliable security protocols therefore similar advanced technology has been adopted for cloud computing.

It's anticipated that computer repair and maintenance, as well as IT employment /contracts will steadily decline as cloud computing rises in popularity.</p>

<p>There has been a proliferation of free public clouds appearing on the internet.</p>

<p>These services, often referred to as SaaS (software as a service) are easy to use, fast, reliable and very good.</p>

<p>You can increase your use of cloud computing to meet a high demand on your resources and you can reduce your usage during low demand. This allows you to adapt to changing conditions without making significant long term investments in personnel, computers, software and operational costs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, cloud computing will assist independent inventors and small businesses to be more efficient and cost effective.</p>

<p>At the very least, it's a leveling of the playing field.</p>
